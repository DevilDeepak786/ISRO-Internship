This project, undertaken at the Space Applications Centre (SAC), Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), under the guidance of Dr. Sandip Paul, Head of SCPD/SEG/SEDA division, involves the design and realization of a complete infrared (IR) imaging system using the ULIS 03 19 1 uncooled long-wave infrared (LWIR) micro bolometer. 
The project’s goal is to develop a lab-scale prototype capable of acquiring, processing, and reconstructing thermal images, leveraging both hardware-level signal conditioning and digital design techniques.
The detector offers a spatial resolution of 384×288 pixels with 12-bit depth per pixel, making it suitable for a wide range of thermal imaging applications including surveillance, remote sensing, and defence systems.
A central challenge in such systems is the precise synchronization between the detector readout, control signals, and real-time acquisition. To address this, an Actel ProASIC3E A3PE1500 FPGA was programmed to generate all the required clocks and control pulses, including the Master Clock (MC) at 4 MHz, Integration Control (INT), Frame Reset signals and Serial Data (SERDAT) Simultaneously, two 10-bit counters tracking row and pixel numbers are used to time-stamp and index each pixel data output, enabling precise image frame reconstruction.
Unlike conventional methods, this project intentionally avoids these interfaces to simplify the signal chain and increase transparency for debugging and testing. 
Instead, a Tektronix logic analyser is used as the primary tool for waveform capture and data acquisition. 
The logic analyser records the digital pixel data, control signals, and address counters directly from the FPGA outputs in real time, capturing every frame with cycle-level accuracy. 
This raw digital capture strategy enhances flexibility during testing and ensures complete observability of the system’s internal timing and logic flow.
Post-acquisition, the recorded data is exported from the logic analyser in a compatible format and processed using MATLAB. This reconstruction parses the 12-bit detector data stream, aligns each pixel with its respective row and column indices, and assembles the full 384×288 image frame. 
Visualization and verification routines are implemented to validate the reconstructed thermal image against expected signal patterns, noise characteristics, and temporal consistency. 
The system has been successfully tested under controlled lab conditions, demonstrating a high degree of accuracy, synchronization, and signal integrity.
Overall, the project proves the feasibility of a memory-less, logic analyser based IR imaging system driven entirely by FPGA logic. 
It provides a modular, flexible platform for future enhancements such as real-time image streaming, automated image correction (e.g., NUC), or integration with low power embedded processors for portable deployment. 
Additionally, the architecture can be easily adapted to support higher frame rates, larger detector arrays, or more complex signal processing algorithms. 
This work contributes to the growing body of knowledge in IR system prototyping, embedded vision, and FPGA-based sensor interfacing, with strong relevance to both academic research and field-deployable systems in space, defence, and environmental monitoring.
